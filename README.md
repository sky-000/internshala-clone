#INTERNSHALA CLONE 
🚀 Internshala Clone – My First Big Step in Web Development!
I’m super excited to share this Internshala clone that I built using just HTML and CSS! 🎉
After learning the basics of web development, I wanted to challenge myself by recreating a real-world website — and this was the perfect project for that.

🛠️ Tech Used:

HTML – for the structure

CSS – for the styling and layout

This project helped me understand how professional websites are built and styled. From navigation bars to section layouts, I got to apply everything I’ve learned so far — and it was a lot of fun!
📌 It’s not responsive yet, but I’m proud of how far I’ve come and can’t wait to keep improving from here!
